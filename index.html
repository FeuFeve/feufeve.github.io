							TERogue is a rogue-like arcade game that can be played alone or in pairs.<br />
							Born from the cooperation between 3 developers, a graphic designer and a sound designer, it
							was developed during our Master's degree, and then quickly became a hobby.<br />
							Originally designed for arcade terminals, it is also playable on PC and with controllers.

							could be very useful.
							Beware, the owners of the place are notorious for not being kind to visitors.

							The "Video FPS Increase" project was proposed by our team of 3 developers as a university
							project, and was supervised by the head of our Master's degree and teacher-researcher at
							LIRMM.
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal was to be able to create an image interpolation algorithm that was precise enough
							not to deteriorate the quality of the videos it processed, and powerful enough to be
							competitive on decent-sized videos.<br />
							These objectives were achieved without the use of AI, thanks to the choice of implementing
							the algorithm in C++ for its efficiency, all in a multithreaded Python environment.

							During my Master's degree in video games and 3D graphics, I was asked to familiarize myself
							with the OpenGL environment. This API allowed me, during many academic and personal projects
							(photo-realistic raytracing, recreation of solar systems, meshing of a point cloud, ...), to
							learn the basics of GPU-oriented programming as well as the mathematics our 3D environments
							are based on.
